      <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
        <p>
          Kudos are essentially a point tracking system implemented within the
          backend of AI Horde in order to determine queue priority and prevent
          general abuse of the service. Those who are logged in with a AI Horde
          API key will get higher priority than anonymous users. Those who are
          logged in and have more kudos will get even higher priority in the
          queue.

          Some image generation parameters (e.g., those determined to be more
          computationaly expensive operations, such as higher resolution images
          or more steps) require an upfront kudos balance. However, most
          operations can be completed without needing the required amount of
          kudos upfront. (Most requests that are less than ~17 kudos can be
          completed without issue.)

        Is there any sort of syntax (prompt weights or prompt matrix)?
      </Question>
      <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
        <p>
          Prompt weighting is available on ArtBot thanks to the Stable Horde. To
          utilize prompt weighting, use the following syntax: subject in
          parenthesis separated by a colon, followed by a number. e.g.,
          (flower:1.2) Example:
          <MonoFont>
            A beautiful photograph of a (blue:1.2) and (red:0.8) flower
          </MonoFont>
        </p>
        <p>
          Any integer greater than 1.0 denotes something you want to give extra
          strength to (e.g., 1.2 = 120%). Anything below 1.0 is something you
          want to deemphasize. Other Stable Diffusion UIs, such as
          Automatic1111, utilize multiple parens and brackets (e.g.,
          ((stronger)) and [[[weaker]]]). That syntax is <strong>not</strong>{' '}
          supported on ArtBot.
        </p>
        <p>
          ArtBot also supports using a prompt matrix -- anything inside brackets
          separated by a pipe character. That looks like this:{' '}
          <MonoFont>{`{thing one|thing two|thing three}`}</MonoFont>
        </p>
        <p>
          Each value will be run separately (and against any other values, if
          provided).For example, the following query will yield 6 images:
          <MonoFont>
            A beautiful forest full of {`{bears|clowns}`}, painted by{' '}
            {`{Bob Ross|Thomas Kinkade|Maurice Sendak}`}

        Why does the estimated time remaining to generate an image seem to

      </Question>
      <div className="">
        This generally happens if you&apos;re an anonymous user. Stable Horde
        uses a priority queue system. Users who provide an API key and have
        kudos are given priority access to the job queue ahead of anonymous
        users. As such, your image request might be shuffled back in the queue
        if a valid registered user creates an image request.

        Why should I get an AI Horde API key and what is it?
      </Question>
      <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
        <p>
          An API key allows you to interact with the AI Horde through the
          numerous tools that have been created in order to interact with the
          service (web apps, mobile apps, CLI utilities, Discord bots, Mastodon
          bots, etc).
        </p>
        <p>
          Another benefit of an API key is that it allows you to skip ahead of
          anonymous users in the queue, allowing you to significantly speed up
          your image generations without have to do anything else.

          What are some of the benefits of running a worker for the AI Horde?
          You earn kudos (meaning faster image generations across the service
          for you), priority image generations with your own worker, the ability
          to help foster a community of fellow open-source generative AI
          enthusiasts, and a desire to see numbers go up (your kudos, the number
          of images created across the service, the number of GPU workers
          available at any given time).

        <p>
          Various operating systems and browsers impose limits on the amount of
          storage that can be utilized by a particular web app. If you&apos;ve
          received this error, you&apos;ll need to remove images from your
          browser&apos;s ArtBot database instance before continuing. Sadly, this
          is a browser and device operating system issue that ArtBot cannot
          workaround.

        <p>After removing some images, please reload the app and try again.</p>

          have more information about this particular issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, on iOS, web apps installed on your homescreen (a.k.a. a
          PWA -- progressive web app) have a hard limit of 1GB of storage space,
          however if using a web app through the Safari browser (or Firefox /
          Chrome / etc... which all utilize Safari&apos;s engine as of this
          writing), initially limit to 1GB of space, but can request more
          storage from the user.
        </p>
        <p>
          On other operating systems and browsers, which don&apos;t act like
          FisherPrice toys, you have a limit of 10% of diskspace (or 10GB,
          whichever is smaller) on Firefox and up to 60% of available diskspace
          in Chrome based browsers.
        </p>
        <p>
          (Note about FisherPrice toys -- this web app is primarily developed
          using one...)

        <p>
          In the future, I will add some more helpful storage management options

        <p>
          <strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> After deleting images from the
          gallery, you might still get quote exceeded errors. This is because
          browser APIs don&apos; t expose a way to run garbage collection on
          IndexDb. This happens automatically... at some point in time. Wait a
          few minutes and try again. I really wish this would be more intuitive.
